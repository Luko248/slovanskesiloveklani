# GEMINI.md - Project Context & Instructions

## 1. Project Overview
**Slovanské Silové Klání 2026** is a promotional static website for an annual amateur strongman competition in Pustiměř, Czech Republic. The site features a dark Viking/Slavic theme and provides event information, registration details via email, and a gallery of past events.

## 2. Technology Stack
- **Framework:** Astro 5.16.4 (Static Site Generator)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4.0.0 (Utility-first, configured via `@theme` in `global.css`)
- **Runtime/Build:** Bun (preferred), Node.js compatible.
- **Language:** TypeScript (Strict mode), HTML/Astro templates.
- **Key Libraries:** `@tailwindcss/vite` (Build tool integration).

## 3. Architecture
The project follows a **Component-Based Static Site** architecture:
- **Single Page Application (SPA) feel:** The main content lives in `src/pages/index.astro`, composed of stacked section components.
- **Components:** Located in `src/components/`, these are self-contained UI sections (Hero, EventInfo, Gallery, etc.) that accept a `lang` prop (currently hardcoded to 'cs').
- **Styling Layer:** Global styles and Tailwind theme variables are defined in `src/styles/global.css`.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** Basic structure exists in `src/i18n/` (`cs.json`, `utils.ts`), using a dot-notation lookup. Currently, only Czech is supported.
- **No Client-Side Hydration:** The site is fully static HTML/CSS, with minimal inline JS for the mobile menu.

## 4. Development Workflow

### Commands
Run these from the project root using `npm` or `bun`:

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `bun run dev` | Start the local development server (localhost:4321). |
| `bun run build` | Build the production site to `./dist/`. |
| `bun run preview` | Preview the production build locally. |
| `bun run astro ...` | Run Astro CLI commands (e.g., `astro add`, `astro check`). |

### Key Files & Directories
- **`src/pages/index.astro`**: The main entry point assembling the landing page.
- **`src/components/`**: Reusable `.astro` UI components.
- **`src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro`**: Main HTML wrapper (Head, Body tags).
- **`src/styles/global.css`**: Tailwind v4 configuration and custom theme definitions.
- **`src/i18n/`**: Translation files and helper utilities.
- **`.planning/`**: "Get Shit Done" (GSD) framework documentation, including roadmap, requirements, and architectural decisions. **Consult these files before major architectural changes.**

## 5. Coding Conventions
- **Styling:** Use Tailwind utility classes primarily. Custom animations and theme colors (e.g., `viking-red`, `charcoal`) are defined in `global.css`.
- **Components:** Keep components focused on a single section or UI element. Use `SectionSeparator.astro` between major page sections.
- **TypeScript:** Strict mode is enabled. Ensure proper typing for component props and utility functions.
- **Images:** Currently using Unsplash placeholders. Future updates may replace these with local assets in `public/`.
- **Responsiveness:** Mobile-first approach. Ensure all designs work on mobile, tablet, and desktop using Tailwind's `md:`, `lg:` prefixes.

## 6. GSD Framework
This project utilizes the **Get Shit Done (GSD)** framework for planning and documentation.
- **Status:** Check `.planning/STATE.md` or `.planning/ROADMAP.md` for current progress.
- **Architecture:** detailed in `.planning/codebase/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **Stack:** detailed in `.planning/codebase/STACK.md`.
