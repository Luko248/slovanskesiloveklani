## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Keep Unsplash for images (no budget for photography, pending acceptance)

- Dark theme only (pending implementation)
- CSS-only carousel (pending implementation)
- MedievalSharp logo text (pending implementation)
- Created eventConfig.ts as single source of truth for all event data (01-01)
- Used 'as const' TypeScript pattern for type safety and immutability (01-01)
- Calculated UTC times correctly: CEST (UTC+2) conversion for June 2026 (01-01)
- Use translate-x-full instead of hidden class for smooth slide animations (01-02)
